    Initial commit


Before the project was in Git:
April 5, 2017
Aleksei: Wrote modular code to draw additional game elements on the VGA and keep track of them. The functions were also written in a way to support code reuse for I/O integration. Also added code for timer interrupt driven motion/re-draw.
Alex: Wrote basic code for testing audio. Elaborated on this code by adding amplitude detection. A document containing the used registers and their exact purpose was included.

March 30, 2017
Aleksei: Set up structure and formatting of the files, created basic interactions with VGA including resetting the screen and other core functionality.
